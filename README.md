# Keira3

Cross-platform desktop application featuring a **Database Editor** for the [AzerothCore MMORPG framework](http://www.azerothcore.org).

With Keira3 you don't have to know the SQL language in order to change contents: it will generate the SQL queries automatically for you. The SQL code will be displayed, so you can **learn**, and then you can **copy** or **execute** it directly to your database.

Made with ‚ù§ and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Work in progress

Keira3 is currently in a WIP state. All the news and releases will be announced via [the forum](https://github.com/azerothcore/forum/issues/21).

## Inspired by

We created Keira inspired by the old [indomit's Quice/Truice](https://github.com/indomit/quice) database editor, and by the [Discover-'s SAI Editor](https://github.com/Discover-/SAI-Editor). Our primary goal was to provide an editor with the same features that was cross-platform, so we built it as a web app.

Keira3 is the direct successor of [Keira2](https://github.com/Helias/Keira2). We kept the cross-platform promise as well as adding the possibility to execute the generated queries and simplifying the application setup.

## Development
